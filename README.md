# PollBooth - Delta Web Task 3

Vikram and Pavithra want to decide upon a design for Delta T Shirt. They decided to put up a poll among Delta members to select a design. So they asked their juniors to develop a portal which facilitates polling among teams.

They need a website which allows creation of teams and polls within the team members built upon a full fledged frontend and backend.

## Normal mode:
<li>Have a user management system with authentication that allows users to register and login on the site
<li>Create a team and be able to invite users to the team
<li>Create a poll with variable number of text options within the team
<li>Create a dashboard for a team and display the polls in chronological order
<li>Show the results of poll after admin ends it
<li>Design a neat, intuitive UI ( make the site responsive, legible text, etc )


Vikram is feeling lazy and wants to set deadlines for automatically ending the polls and add some other cool features
